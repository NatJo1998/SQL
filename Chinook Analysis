#In this project I've used data from the Chinook database. 

#The first three questions are ones I had myself:

#1. Which customers are from Germany?
select FirstName,LastName,CustomerId,Country
from chinook.customers
where country="Germany";

#2. Which employees have a job title that is not "Manager"?
select FirstName,LastName,EmployeeId,Title
from chinook.employees
where Title!="Manager";

#3. Which customers are from the United States, and what are their postal codes?
select FirstName,LastName,State,PostalCode
from chinook.customers
where Country="USA";

#The following questions are the example questions given with the database:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
select FirstName,LastName,CustomerId,Country
from chinook.customers
where Country !="USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
select FirstName,LastName,CustomerId,Country
from chinook.customers
where Country="Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
select
  c.FirstName||' '||c.LastName as FullName,
  i.InvoiceId,
  i.InvoiceDate,
  i.BillingCountry
from invoices i
join customers c on i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
where c.Country='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
select *
from employees
where Title='Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
select distict BillingCountry
from invoices
order by BillingCountry asc;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
select
    e.FirstName||' '||e.LastName as SalesAgentFullName,
    c.FirstName||' '||c.LastName as CustomerFullName,
    i.InvoiceId,
    i.InvoiceDate,
    i.BillingAddress,
    i.BillingCity,
    i.BillingState,
    i.BillingCountry,
    i.Total
from invoices i
join customers c on i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
join employees e on c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId
order by e.LastName,e.FirstName;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
select 
    i.Total as InvoiceTotal,
    c.FirstName||' '||c.LastName as CustomerName,
    c.Country as CustomerCountry,
    e.FirstName||' '||e.LastName as SalesAgentName
from invoices i
join customers c on i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
join employees e on c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId
order by c.LastName,c.FirstName;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
select count(*) as InvoiceCount
from invoices
where InvoiceDate>='2009-01-01'
and InvoiceDate<'2010-01-01';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
select sum(ii.Quantity) as TotalSales
from invoice_items ii
join invocies i on ii.InvoiceId=i.InvoiceId
where i.InvoiceDate>='2009-01-01'
and i.InvoiceDate<'2010-01-01';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
select invoice_items.InvoiceId,tracks.Name as TrackName
from invoice_items
join tracks on invoice_items.TrackId=tracks.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
select invoice_items.InvoiceId,tracks.Name as TrackName,Composer
from invoice_items
join tracks on invoice_items.TrackId=tracks.TrackId;
